What a day.
Woke up early from the the Gatsby House to go grab coffee. Decided to head out as early as possibly to get and oil change and take care of stuff at Walmart.

We got to OKC around 3:30 and were directed to this really awesome part of town. Pretty much a bunch of neat shops and cafes in a really nice setting. Enjoyed some coffee from a cafe called the Parish, and then had some BADASS food from this pizzeria across the street. Empire Slice House made all these super great artesian pizzas and i had these Stuffed Banana Peppers. Super spicy and incredibly tasty.

Decided to go load in since the venue ended up being literally a block away. Bad Granny’s Bazaar was a vintage thrift store/trinket shop with the sweetest lady ever as the owner. The venue part was a room in the back of the store that basically felt like a really intimate house show. The only downside was worrying about the bar next door calling the cops on us. Which is weird because you’d think that a bar would be chill about that.

The first two bands were honestly pretty shitty. The first one was this sort of pop punk/ska band. Terrible. They were followed by a somehow worse band; some sort of jam band with now vocals and one guitar amp for two guys.  What really sealed the terribleness was that it took them forever to get off the stage. I actually offered to help the drummer, but “i got it, thanks!” They took so long that Richard eventually just started moving their guitar amp out of the way since they obviously weren’t going to. I can’t stand that level of unprofessionalism. We thought about finding them afterwards and explaining why all of it was so annoying, but honestly it wouldn’t have helped. We’d have just ended up being “that asshole band”.

Something however is going right. We are SLAYING these shows so far. We started to a half full room, maybe 10 kids. By the time we stopped it was packed, which in all fairness was only about 35 people. I saw smiles and head bobbing and all the fun things you always hope for. Marcos even attempted climbing the pa speakers on the side, and while it looked cool it threw off the end of “Obnoxygen”. But we pulled out of the weirdness and finished on point. As long as we just look at each other and smile no one will ever notice, or if they do they wont care because we’re obviously not worried and just wanna have fun.

The final two bands were pretty ok. I missed their names, which makes me an asshole, but i was too exhausted to care.

I have to say that i’ve never experience a DIY show quite like this. Since it was a donation show there was the obligatory TIP bucket being passed around. In stark contrast to my expectations they raised us $200. I mean, wow. That’s just insane. We also sold about 50 bucks in merch and some other tips too. Absolutely one of the best crowds i’ve met yet.

Good Night OKC. We’ll most definitely be back.
