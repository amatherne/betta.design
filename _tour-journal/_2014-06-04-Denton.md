Crusty house show in Denton, fuck yeah. Playing in a hot as fuck garage.

Whoa. A shitty one-man-band version of Hella. The music itself is actually neat, but the guy is just wailing on drums. First night back on the road in almost a decade and sure enough the first band up is this weird ass shit.

Ok. I half take back the shitty comment. It’s definitely interesting. I think the drummer in me is just upset at the lack of good form. “Not Lando” is just some odd spastic shit. Unfortunately he only used his guitar once because of a broken string, but the prerecorded loops were still neat.

Up next was a band made up of residents of the house. Total…well, cockrock, but in the absolute best way. Killer “guitarmonies”. Just super fun to watch. I tried to catch as much as i can while i was setting up in the living room.


Our label mates The Hawks  (Of The Holy Rosary) followed. There were running late due to traffic so we let them borrow my kit. I let him borrow it on the same terms as i tell all drummers:

    “You can use it but you can’t move anything, it’s all locked in.”

So he literally and truly moved every single adjustment he could. I am never again allowing any drummer to borrow my gear. I’m just done. The band was good enough that i still enjoyed watching despite wanting to tear the ass’s head off. Really cutesy pop music, they’re actually meeting up with Dr. Dog tonight for a tour. Good for them, hopefully they don’t use the same “fat band” and “man tits” dialogue they used tonight. I doubt Dr. Dog will be impressed.

Once i got my kit back i working order, we SLAYED. It was absolutely one of the best shows we’ve played yet. Kids were jamming along so hard. Marcos even (unintentionally) got people finger snapping along with one of the quiet parts, and i think he “stole” a kids nose later. Had a girl tell me that at first she was just sitting watching but she had to get up and dance. She couldn’t sit still anymore. Best compliment.

Two Knights closed it out, and i was pretty excited to see them. Anthony Taylor had been telling me how awesome they were and they did not disappoint. Spazy scram stuff. Very cool They managed to do the finger tapping nuts stuff while also keep in smooth and simple right when it needed it.

Ended up “tizing it” (1/2 off apps) with the house dudes at Applebee’s afterwards. Good times, but fuck that fucking shithole.
