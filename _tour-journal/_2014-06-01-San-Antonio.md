The time has finally come. I've been waiting almost a decade to experience life on the road again.

We've got our van, our gear, and our bags packed. So, things went awry almost immediately.

I woke up early so i could finish my to-do list of random shit i had to do in prep for leaving. First up was to run some errands in the van. Which decided it didn't want to start. Now, tour officially begins in 3 days. Fuck. I didn't want to scare the guys but they needed to know and we collectively spent the follow 3 hours having anxiety attacks over whether or not we were fucked before we started. Thankfully it was only a battery issue and after several trips across town with a few jump starts we were golden again. I am praying to the patron saint of touring bands and travelers that this will be our only major breakdown.

Though we haven't actually left yet, we had our first show tonight at the LimeLight in San Antonio. We had the chance to open for SuperHeaven, formerly Daylight. The show was subpar, but fuck it. We had fun. I can definitely say that i hope i never have to play that venue again though. It always leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. BUT, i know it's inevitable that we'll be back there for some awful reason.

Superheaven ended up staying at Scott's (the Texas Is Funny HQ) and i can't remember the last time i met a band so boring. We tried to get em talking but they just sort of slumped in and starred at their phones. I realize that being on the road means you get no personal time and that sometimes you just wanna zone out, but you should at least humor your hosts a little first.

It gave me a glimpse of things i will be careful about on this new journey. I want people to remember VK as friends. I want to leave doors open and let people know how much i appreciate their time, effort, and of course money.
There's no telling what will this first tour will lead to. I surely only have failures to look back to, but i am forever optimistic that this might finally be my time.

Note able ridiculous quote:(on the subject of Mr. Hands, an awful internet viral video of a man letting a horse sodomize him and then dying from it)
