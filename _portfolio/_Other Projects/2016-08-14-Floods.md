### Project Bio

A year ago I participated in a Hackathon. All the classes grouped together and got to pitch ideas. Each idea was written on a post it and put on the walls around the classroom. A recent bit of heavy weather had hit in Austin, which really hit home for me. I choose a pitch that involved highlighting flood zones and water levels in affected areas.

A team of myself, a Rails Student, and a Front End Student built a website called Texas Floods in Heroku. It used Google maps API and was fully responsive. The final build would of course have some sort of forum so everyone could communicate. A service that would have been amazingly usefull during the events in Louisiana this weekend.
