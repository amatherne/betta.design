Full disclosure: I found these photos on "the google", I have no intention on selling any of these pieces I'm going to start making. Just tryin to learn, yall. Also, when I'm hired and not poor I'll be able to buy rights obv.

This time around, working with water caught my attention. Some sort of underwater landscape within a fishbowl. And a tiny person floating inside for good measure. Each photo I used has been included below for reference! It was really fun using the warp tool on the contents of the bowl. Again, trying to not focus to much on perfection yet. I just want to keep churning out new pieces, that's always been the best way for me to learn.
