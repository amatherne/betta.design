### What I Said...


Not just a poignant quote from a Tv show we reference in class; often. It's a specific feeling you can experience at different points in your life. You feel it when you may have a lot on your plate for the first time in a while. Or ever. And the real decisions are there. Maybe even the real consequences of failures.
<!--excerpt break-->

The juggle that is being in a semi-working band, a relationship, and first time full time student is one i've never really ever experienced. Add in the opposite sleep schedule conflicts i've been dealing with and you've definitely got a good show to watch. But I'm trying to choose to come at this from a different from normal path. 

I want to step up to my new routines and obligations and step out the other side proud and full of life. I've avoided things just because I was scared of not knowing what to find. I still have days where I feel like any effort required is too much. In order to break this nasty habit, I'm doing things. I'm playing music more, paddlingboarding, entering a new career and lifestyle entirely.

So.
