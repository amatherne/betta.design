I've been playing music with Marcos Gossi for almost 6 years. He's been a dynamic force in my life the entire way. He consistently brings new ideas and bigger thoughts into both my life and the music we make. Just like anyone else, he frequently uses similar phrases over and over; my favorite line is:

##Try doing 'blank'..... just for funsies.


It can be about a new chorus, a "VK Stop"<sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup><fig class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup>The <span>VK Stop</span> is a catchall term we coined to describe a certain music motif we use a lot.</fig>, a drum fill, a vocal line, or anything else he comes up with. His word choice makes it feel just like that: for funsies. It takes the pressure and anxiety away and lets new ideas flow freely. It lets us make suggestions to each other and experiment without hurting feelings. And some of my favorite sections of songs have come from this phrase. 

##Bringing this into Design

We've begun doing peer critiques on our projects in class. We do them to double check our ideas and see if they are feasable outside our own minds. This can be terrifying as a new designer. You're already feeling the sting of uncertainty that comes with learning a new craft; add in the presentation of unfinished work and you've got a recipe for distress. 

What we're having to learn is that ideas need molding. Sure, there are those inspired individuals that pump out amazing work after work. But even they have editors, producers, and assistants to help them process thier work. So, like those brilliant minds and like Marcos suggesting what I might play, I need to learn to accept suggestions because you never know where your "Eureka" moment could come from. You aren't obligated to use their idea exactly, this is your work, but you can take points from it that make sense and merge theirs with yours.

Another aspect of "funsies" is the pure experimentation; the complete freedom of a beautiful and terrifingly blank canvas. There's so many colors, fonts, notes, chords, <span class="quick">layouts, drum patterns, brush types,</span><span class="quicker"> oils, animations, pencil weights, clays</span> ........ and now you've fainted from option overload.<sup class="sidenote-number">2</sup><fig class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">2</sup> Option Overload. I should copyright that...or just link to the Dillinger Escape Plan album 'Option Paralysis'....which is the musical representation of this feeling.</fig> It's nothing to be ashamed of. Fear of the unknown would be my vote for the first bug fix on Homo-Sapien v2.0; it's caused so much pain. But really, that unknown is the most fulfilling part of the artistic experience. Putting the tentative last touches on a project and wondering "Wow... how did i even make this" is the best feeling. <fig class="sidenote">Fine. <BR><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1NdhsDqC7l6z0PldTOnIWQ">'Option Paralysis' by The Dillinger Escape Plan</a><br>Dont say i didn't warn you.</fig>You've allowed yourself to venture into that uncharted territory and came back with proof that you could survive it. And it feels phenominal. 

If you bring your creative idea into the world, only good things could come from it.<sup class="sidenote-number">3</sup><fig class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">3</sup>....usually.</fig> If for no other reason than this "bad idea" is out of your head. It's gotten out like it wanted. Now your mind is free for the "next new thought". You might be surprised at how much your brain progressed just by opening room for the new thought. 

I hope this doesn't read back as a super bullshit motivational speech. I just want yall to make art.
