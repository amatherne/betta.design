Our class was tasked with making a table of contents of what our Style Guides will look like. This is the one i came up with. Seeing this in front of me actually helps me grasp what i need in my design process. Thanks, Rubber Ducky.

### Client Background/History

- What they do.
- Why they do it.
- Accomplishments of Client

### Research

- First Landing Walkthrough
    + Watch someone who's never been to site before navigate it
    + Document each step of their process
        * Is each step necissary?

- SWOT Analysis
- On-Location photography and style analysis (if possible)

    
### User Stories

- What do the users actually do on the site.
- Include as many stories from different types of users

### Evaluate Findings

- State Findings of Research
    + Problems Identified
    + Immediate / Long Term Goals
    + Final Solutions
- Plan of Implementation
    + Time Line
    + Importance Level
- Discuss CMS with Client
    + Which one do they want and why?
    + Which do you suggest for them?
- This / Not That with Client
    + Helps figure out how they see themselves and what they want
    + Encourage Client to Sketch with you
    + ex: We're Fun. Not Sad.
    + ex: We're Punk. Not Emo.

### Discovery Stage

- Experimentation / Trial & Error
    + Word Lists
    + Textures
    + Photo/Art/Design Inspiration
    + Color
- Sketching (can be done in Illustrator as well, but always pen / paper first)
    + Morphalogical Matrixes
        * 45 second stream of consciousness excercise
        * Pick random items from word list and see how they could match up
        * Save Each Variation
    + Basic Layout and Design Ideas

### Style Decisions

- Semi-Final Style Tiles / Collages
- Detailed Layout Sketches
- Detail Pattern Examples
    + Margins, Padding, Borders, Spacing, 
    + ex: "this" is always "there"
    + ex: "this" is what a 3 column row looks like at "this" screen size
- Design a version of every element possible
    + even ones you aren't planning to use now
    + Client may decide to use it later and doing it now gives them the guide just in case

### Layout

- Low Resolution Wireframes
- Pixel Perfect Mockups

### Implementation

- Build of actual site structure
- Inclusion of Fallbacks / Mixins / Partials
- Test Every Page on All Screen Sizes and in All Browsers

### Future Plans / Goals

- Discussions of ideas to implement once main goals have been completed

### ....8?

- ...uuhhhhhhhh..

### Profit
