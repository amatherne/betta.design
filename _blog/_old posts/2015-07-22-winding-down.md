I stayed up *just about* all of last night. Forced myself to sleep at 7:00am. I've had a shower, breakfast, and i'm now 17 minutes into my second to last design lecture. (I'm killin' it today.) I find that I work myself into a late night groove and it's difficult to pull myself out of it at times. 

It's a routine thing for me really. Even before I began my pedicab life I was pluggin away at the late hours pushing out some sort of creative content. Typically music oriented. My first band (to do something besides only playing locally) wouldnt even begin our practices until 11pm or later. And we were dedicated. 5-6 nights a week with school (for two of them) and jobs (for the other 3 of us). It somehow worked well, and now I'm somewhat set in my ways.


In class we're reaching our climax. This is the end of week....9? .... I dont even know anymore... and we began our final of two lectures today. We're discussing Brand Identity and Logo Design, which i'm pretty excited about. Thinking back, I always had an interest in Branding. My favorite shows and bands have a feeling or a sentiment or even a nostalgia, be it intrinsic or accidental. We discussed in class how that view or feeling of a product is the Brand Identity; not the colors and shapes that represent them in the advertising.

As an example, one of my favorite bands from my early 20's was a group called GlassJaw. They were chaotic, and heavy, and emotional, and i've still never heard anything like them. All of these words I just used to describe them are their branding. Those words are my view of what they do. On top of that, they have a logo that I've ALWAYS loved. It's a beautifully simple combination of the 'G' and the 'J'. It's the first logo I recognized as being part of who they were.
