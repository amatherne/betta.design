Full disclosure: I found these most of these photos on "the google", I have no intention on selling any of these pieces I'm making. Just tryin to learn, yall. Also, when I'm hired and not poor I'll be able to buy rights obv. 


This is the [tutorial I followed](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-an-emotional-molten-shattered-statue-in-photoshop--psd-17575)! I went my own way, of course. I'll have to bring out the Wacom Pad next time. I never thought I'd be able to make things like this!
