I figured out that I have been receiving 10 free stock photos a month from Adobe. I had somewhere around 30; now just 8. Before ACL I was working on a piece that would have a different scene playing out on each open book in a stack. Water flowing over the top for some sort of sea battle. Maybe magicians or a Scifi landscape popping out of others. Needless to say, it was a little outside my abilities. I'm going to keep working on it. Using the new skills I pick up each week to get a little closer to whats in my head. 

Today was the first real day off I've had since ACL began. Feeling down that I was unable to manifest my book idea, an easier manipulation sounded like a good boost. Comic Book style halftone! I found a youtube tutorial and then a stock photo. I did the tutorial a couple times from start to finish to see if I could further refine what I was looking for.


This is the [tutorial I followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS6k9ax4joI)!
