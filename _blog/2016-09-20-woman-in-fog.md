The Photoshop icon in my dock has been looming at me for months. I'd attempted the tackle the program years ago with little luck. After my recent success with using the iPad as a sketching tool I decided to give it a second try. 

Full disclosure: I found these photos on "the google", I have no intention on selling any of these pieces I'm going to start making. Just tryin to learn, yall. Also, when I'm hired and not poor I'll be able to buy rights obv.

Ok.

As a first lesson I decided to learn to make a daytime photo look like it was taken at night. I used the google again and found a few video tutorials as well as some text walkthroughs explaining how to achieve this look correctly. I love erie looking (and sounding) things. Fog felt right. It would be another google search, a dozen videos, and a few hours of intense concentration until I was "satisfied". The last thing it needed was a centerpiece.

The woman was inspired by a series I've been listening to on audiobook while tinkering on my computer, The Wheel Of Time. Highly recommend. The woman in the picture is actually an Indian man wearing a dress. I didn't notice that until after I had finished the piece, and now that small piece of info is my favorite part. Whoever he is, he's rocking that dress. Did my best to match her to the background with saturation and color filters. (I'm going with 'her' because I assume that would be the point?)

The final step was shading her in and making the fog appear around and in front of her properly. I see a lot of areas I could have maybe done better. But I'd rather get it to a point where I'm reasonably happy enough to move on to another piece. I'll only get better the more piece I make.
